With DTO, employees do not\naccrue time off. Instead, they can take the time they need when they need it for such things as\nvacation, staycation, volunteerism, and recreation without worrying about whether they\u2019ve\naccrued enough vacation or exceeded a maximum amount of vacation allowed per year.\n\nEssentially, DTO may be used for any reason not covered by Microsoft\u2019s Leave of\nAbsence\u00a0(LOA) programs or other time away offerings, including Holistic Heath Time Off\n\nhttps://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/HRweb/SitePages/FAQ_DTO.aspx?xsdata=MDV8MDF8fGJjMmUzZjdlMGZjZjQwZGJjMDgzMDhkYmUwOTMzZjVmfD\u2026 1/10\n\n\u00a0\n\f11/13/23, 1:05 PM\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ) about Discretionary Time Off (DTO)\n\n(HHTO; formerly sick and mental health time off), Jury Duty, and Bereavement Leave. Because\nDTO eliminates the need to accrue a fixed With DTO, U.S. benefits-eligible salaried/exempt\nemployees don't accrue vacation time; rather, employees may take DTO throughout the year\nto best meet their work/life needs. Eligible employees don't formally record vacation time.\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nWhy does Microsoft offer DTO instead of a traditional vacation accrual policy?\n\nWe are always working to improve the employee experience at Microsoft. The importance of\nflexibility and work/life balance is crucial to support employee wellbeing and attract and retain\ntalent. As we\u2019ve transformed the way we work, we also felt it important to modernize our\nvacation policy to a more flexible model. Many tech organizations, including LinkedIn, Netflix\nSalesforce, Symantec, Adobe, VMware, NVIDIA and others, have embraced programs like DTO.\nWe believe DTO is a good fit as it reflects our values of trust and accountability and builds\nupon the culture of flexibility we\u2019ve created.\n\nWe understand that our employees have demands and interests beyond work, and we trust\nthat they will be responsible for making sure their tasks and projects still get done and get\ndone well regardless of the time they take away from the office. We ask that the investment we\nare making be mutual. In return for flexibility, we expect our employees to invest in our\nmission so our organization can thrive, our customers are supported, and colleagues can\nbalance their lives, too.\n\nDiscretionary Time Off (DTO) eligibility\n\nCollapse all\n\n\ue70d\n\nWho is and is not eligible for DTO?\n\nU.S. benefits-eligible salaried/exempt full-time and part-time employees are all eligible for\nDTO. Hourly non-exempt employees, interns, visiting researchers and visiting artists, and\ncontingent staff are not eligible for DTO. Employees of Microsoft minimally integrated\nacquisitions are not eligible since they have separate benefits, including time away and\nvacation policies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nWhy aren\u2019t hourly/non-exempt U.S. benefits-eligible employees eligible for DTO?\n\nThe requirements of Federal and state wage and hour laws make adopting untracked DTO\nprohibitively difficult for our non-exempt employees because employers must pay hourly/non-\nexempt employees for all hours worked, including overtime for certain hours worked as well as\nvacation and sick leave. This ensures that they are compensated appropriately. DTO, which is\nnot tracked, would prevent us from appropriately compensating these employees as required.\u00a0\nNote that the companies we benchmarked against take a similar view. \n\nThat said, Microsoft offers best-in-class benefits to all employees and will continue to ensure\nthe value proposition for hourly/non-exempt employees is exceptional by offering generous\ntime away benefits to help them rest and recharge. \u00a0\n\nhttps://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/HRweb/SitePages/FAQ_DTO.aspx?xsdata=MDV8MDF8fGJjMmUzZjdlMGZjZjQwZGJjMDgzMDhkYmUwOTMzZjVmfD\u2026 2/10\n\n\f11/13/23, 1:05 PM\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ) about Discretionary Time Off (DTO)\n\n\ue70d\n\nWhat other time-off programs are available to U.S. employees in addition to DTO?\n\nIn addition to DTO, Microsoft offers Holistic Health Time Off (HHTO, formerly sick and mental\nhealth time off), Jury Duty, and Bereavement Leave. \u00a0Microsoft\u2019s Leave of Absence\u00a0programs\nremain the same, including the benefits provided for short- and long-term disability. Visit the\nTime Away Guide for a full list.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nWill DTO be introduced globally?\n\nNo, not at this time. We will continue to benchmark local practices where possible, but many\nlocal country laws and regulations are not conducive to a DTO program. Many countries\noutside the US have employment law that requires companies to provide a minimum number\nof vacation days.\u00a0 Microsoft would be non-compliant if we were to introduce DTO where this\nlegal minimum requirement is in place.\u00a0Most large, global companies that have DTO in the U.S.\nhave not implemented it in international locations for these reasons.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nAre employees of Microsoft minimally integrated companies, such as Gaming\nStudios, eligible for DTO?\n\nNo, if an acquired company is not fully integrated, then those employees remain on their own\nseparate benefits including vacation and other time-away programs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nAre new hires eligible for DTO?\n\nYes, U.S. benefits-eligible salaried exempt employees are eligible for DTO upon hire.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nWhat happens if I transfer from a salaried to an hourly role?   \n\nIf you move from a salaried to an hourly role, at the time of transfer, you will begin to accrue\nvacation according to your years of service and the applicable Retail\u00a0or Corporate hourly\npolicy will apply. The Holistic Health Time Off and Floating Holiday Programs for hourly/non-\nexempt employees will apply to you.\u00a0 Please review the DTO policy for more details.\n\nImpact on Annual Rewards, promotions, bonuses, and sales roles\n\n\ue70d\n\nWill taking time on DTO negatively impact Annual Rewards?\n\nNo, time on DTO is considered Bonus eligible salary for Annual Rewards.

Expectations for impact should reflect this need for time\naway to refresh and recharge.\n\nThe amount of DTO you take should not be a factor for determining rewards or talent\ndecisions. As a reminder, you are expected to deliver successful impact as you take advantage\nof DTO, and you must obtain advanced approval from your manager before taking DTO. You\nand your manager are expected to align on when the time off will be taken and how core\nbusiness functions will be covered, managed, and achieved during any DTO.\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nI'm on a WWIC utilization-based incentives (UBI) plan - how does DTO affect target\nsetting?\n\nPlease reach out to your direct manager for assistance. Learn more about your plan\nat: ICguide. \n\nUsing DTO\n\nCollapse all\n\n\ue70d\n\nIs there a limit on how much DTO I can take annually or at one time?\n\nThere is no cap or limit to the amount of DTO that employees are permitted to take. As with\nthe current vacation policy, all requests for time off require manager approval to ensure\nbusiness continuity and appropriate team coverage.\u00a0\n\nNote, DTO requests for 4 or more consecutive weeks off require review by the direct manager\nplus approval at the GM level or above.  With direct manager support of the request, the\nmanager will forward it for further GM+ review on their direct report's behalf.\n\nIf you or your manager is unsure of your organization\u2019s structure and want to know who the\nGM or above level of approver will be, visit Who+ | People Search (microsoft.com) and search\non your name to find your organization\u2019s hierarchy.  GM+ includes titles such as Partner and\nCVP.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nDoes DTO require manager approval?\n\nDTO is subject to your manager's approval and in accordance with the business needs of your\norganization/team.\u00a0\n\nYou\u2019re required to obtain advanced approval from your manager before you take DTO. To take\ntime off, discuss scheduling and your time-off needs with your manager. You and your\nmanager should work together to:\u00a0\n\nConfirm the request falls under the DTO policy versus a leave of absence or other time\naway option.\n\nhttps://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/HRweb/SitePages/FAQ_DTO.aspx?xsdata=MDV8MDF8fGJjMmUzZjdlMGZjZjQwZGJjMDgzMDhkYmUwOTMzZjVmfD\u2026 4/10\n\n\f11/13/23, 1:05 PM\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ) about Discretionary Time Off (DTO)\n\nDetermine the capability of the team to successfully meet its assigned deliverables.\nEnsure appropriate coverage in the business cycle, taking into account other team\nmembers\u2019 requests for time off.\nAssess your ability to meet your work commitments and duties.\nUse best practices to document and notify teammates and relevant stakeholders of the\ndates they will be taking DTO using calendar invites, Outlook signatures, Teams status\nupdates or other communication methods.\n\nBoth you and your manager have a responsibility to ensure that there is a clear understanding\nof when the time off will be taken and that core business functions are covered, managed, and\nachieved during any DTO.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s important to remember that DTO cannot be used for reasons covered by Microsoft\u2019s\nLeave of Absence (LOA) programs or other Time Away offerings, including Holistic Heath Time\nOff (formerly sick and mental health time off), Jury Duty, and Bereavement Leave.\n\n\ue70d\n\nWhat if I want to take more than four weeks of DTO continuously, what is the\napproval process?\n\nDTO requests for four or more consecutive weeks off require review by the direct manager\nplus approval at the GM level or above.   GM+ includes titles such as Partner and CVP. With\ndirect manager support of the request, the manager will forward requests for four or more\nconsecutive weeks for further GM+ approval on their direct report's behalf.  GM+ employees\nseeking DTO for any length of time will go to their direct manager for approval. \u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nMy manager is currently gone on DTO. How do I get approval for DTO I want to\ntake?\n\nIf your manager is out, and you did not get DTO approval in advance of their absence, you\nshould seek skip-level approval.\n\n\ue70d\n\nDo I track my DTO time via TAR?\n\nNo. However, to create clarity for your team and your manager, discuss with your manager the\nbest approach for documenting your days off.\u00a0 For example, you can log your out-of-office\ntime with your manager, team, and stakeholders via an Outlook calendar request (non-\nblocking), in Teams status, or a designated team calendar. Always set an Outlook auto-reply\nmessage.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nCan I use DTO for learning or training purposes?\n\nLearning is core to our culture at Microsoft. Much of the learning or training you do will be\nbusiness related, and it\u2019s not necessary to take DTO. However, if you are taking time away for\nlearning or training that is not business related, you can use DTO as long as you have obtained\nmanager approval.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nCan I use DTO if I'm sick?\n\nNo, if you are sick, you should use and log your Holistic Health Time Off in TAR and take the\ntime you need to recover.

Your time away for volunteering is subject to manager\napproval. We encourage all employees to participate in year-round giving through\nvolunteerism. If you volunteer during your personal time or while on approved DTO and all\nother volunteer match eligibility criteria is met, the time you spend volunteering is eligible for\nMicrosoft\u2019s $25/hour cash match. All employees are eligible to match up to a maximum of\n$15,000 per year by way of donations and/or volunteering per calendar year. Learn more at\nGIVE.\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nCan DTO be used before or after a leave of absence, e.g., parental, maternity, etc.?\n\nThe use of DTO prior to a leave of absence or following a leave of absence is subject to\nmanager pre-approval, consistent with the purpose of DTO (to enjoy rest, recreation, and\nvolunteerism). There is no limit or cap on how much time you can take annually. DTO requests\nfor 4 or more consecutive weeks off require review by the direct manager plus approval at the\nGM level or above.  GM+ includes titles such as Partner and CVP. With direct manager support\nof the request, the manager will forward it for further GM+ review on their direct report's\nbehalf.\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nCan I use DTO to cover the period of time I am stuck outside of the U.S. because of\nU.S. visa stamping delays at the U.S. Embassy/Consulate after I apply for a U.S. visa\nstamp?\n\nIf your manager authorized you to take DTO for a specific amount of time, and you will exceed\nthat period of time because you are stuck outside of the U.S. due to visa stamping issues or\ndelays at the U.S. Embassy/Consulate after you apply for a U.S. visa stamp, please create a\ncase with AskHR.\u00a0 You will be connected with a Benefits Business Partner to work with you on\nyour leave of absence options.\n\nLearn more: Microsoft Global Mobility Payroll and Tax Compliance Policy \n\n\ue70d\n\nI have exhausted my allocated leave of absence or HHTO (e.g., 12 weeks of Family\nCaregiver Leave, 26 weeks of Short-Term Disability, 80 hours of HHTO, etc.) but\nwould like to extend my time away. Can I seek approval of DTO to continue it?\n\nEven when you have used all of your leave of absence or HHTO time available to you, DTO is\nnot a substitution to extend paid time-away for that leave purpose.\u00a0 If you\u2019re seeking\ncontinued time away related to your leave or HHTO absence, please create a case with AskHR\nand ask to be connected with your Benefits Business Partner, who will discuss any available\ntime off and/or accommodation options with you.\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nIs DTO intended to be a sabbatical?\n\nhttps://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/HRweb/SitePages/FAQ_DTO.aspx?xsdata=MDV8MDF8fGJjMmUzZjdlMGZjZjQwZGJjMDgzMDhkYmUwOTMzZjVmfD\u2026 6/10\n\n\f11/13/23, 1:05 PM\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ) about Discretionary Time Off (DTO)\n\nNo, DTO is not intended to be used as a sabbatical. You and your manager can work to\nschedule your DTO time. DTO requests for 4 or more consecutive weeks off require review by\nthe direct manager plus approval at the GM level or above.  GM+ includes titles such as\nPartner and CVP.\u00a0 With direct manager support of the request, the manager will forward it for\nfurther GM+ review on their direct report's behalf.\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nCan I use DTO to regularly work a different schedule?\n\nNo. DTO is designed to support time off for vacation, staycation and volunteering time, but\nnot an ongoing change to your way of working. Flexible work @ Microsoft is committed to\nexploring new ways of working that support individual workstyles, while balancing business\nneeds and ensuring we live our culture. If you are interested in working a different schedule or\nfewer hours per week, we encourage you to have a 1:1 with your manager about how you\nwork best, align to your team agreements, and request any changes to your workplace\ndesignations as needed in Employee Central.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf you are working outside of your primary work location, learn more: Hybrid Workplace\nFlexibility Payroll and Tax Guidance\n\n\ue70d\n\nI\u2019m concerned my manager won\u2019t approve my DTO requests.\n\nDTO requests must always consider business needs and resource planning. While managers\nwill do their best to accommodate requests, there are times when business continuity will take\nprecedence and DTO may not be approved. However, when this occurs, we will look to our\nmanagers and employees to work together to schedule DTO for an alternative timeframe\nwhen the DTO request can be supported.\u00a0\n\nOne way that you can help is by making a habit of early planning. Talk with your manager well\nin advance of your DTO request for approval and then get it on the calendar.\u00a0\n\nYou may reach out to AskHR for additional support by using search phrase \u2018manager approval\u2019\nand then select \u2018create AskHR case\u2019.\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nWill my manager consider other factors when reviewing DTO requests?\n\nA manager\u2019s decision whether to approve a DTO request will be based on business continuity\nneeds and productivity requirements of the team. Business needs include your ability to\ncomplete work with near-term deadlines or department priorities. Your manager should not\nset their own \u201ccaps\u201d or \u201climits\u201d for DTO. DTO already taken, length of service, or level will not\naffect whether DTO requests are approved. However, managers will consider team coverage\nand overlapping DTO requests. We have provided guidelines and resources for managers to\nsupport effective discussion about and use of DTO within their teams.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nHow do I know how much time I can take in a year under a policy with such\nambiguity? Or is this just a strategy to get employees to take less time?\n\nThe DTO policy is not an attempt to have our employees take less time. On the contrary, we\nknow that without vacation time, your health, happiness, and imagination suffer, leading to\nburnout, poor engagement, and a lack of innovation. You understand the demands of your\nrole better than anybody, and we trust that you will have proactive conversations with your\n\nhttps://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/HRweb/SitePages/FAQ_DTO.aspx?xsdata=MDV8MDF8fGJjMmUzZjdlMGZjZjQwZGJjMDgzMDhkYmUwOTMzZjVmfD\u2026 7/10\n\n\f11/13/23, 1:05 PM\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ) about Discretionary Time Off (DTO)\n\nmanager and make responsible decisions about when you want to take time off. DTO will allow\nyou to schedule time off more strategically based on team needs, business continuity, and\nyour workload.\n\nThe DTO policy treats employees as individuals and gives them the freedom to adapt their\ntime off to their circumstances. Time off is a personal matter\u2014ask five people how much time\noff they need, and you\u2019ll get five different answers. Work styles and personal lives differ, both\nfrom person to person and from year to year. These differences impact the amount of time off\npeople need in order to lead healthy, productive lives.\u00a0\n\nMany companies have already moved to this type of modern time away policy, and studies\nshow that employees took roughly the same number of vacation days under a DTO policy or\njust slightly more as they did under the more traditional accrued time-off system.\u00a0\n\nWe encourage all our employees to take the time they need to rejuvenate.\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nWill I receive a payout of DTO if I leave the company or transfer to another Microsoft\nsubsidiary?\n\nNo. Under the DTO policy, there is no accrual of time off and no entitlement to a specific\nnumber of days off per year. This means that no vacation balance will be reflected on your\npaystub or in a time tracking tool.\u00a0\n\nAccrued, unused vacation time will be cashed out only in the following situations, per local\npolicy and legal requirements:\u00a0\n\nIf you transfer from an International Microsoft subsidiary to the United States\u00a0\nIf you were an hourly/non-exempt employee and were recently moved into a\nsalaried/exempt position, you will stop accruing vacation time and will be eligible for\nDTO upon transfer. Your unused, accrued vacation balance, if any, will be paid out.\n\n\ue70d\n\nI am leaving Microsoft. Can DTO be used to extend my termination date?\n\nNo, DTO cannot be used to extend employment prior to an employee\u2019s termination date.\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nHow can I best support this change?\n\nTaking time off can directly affect your manager, colleagues, partners, and customers.\u00a0 Make it\na practice of providing as much advance notice as you realistically can and any information,\nthey need in order to operate without you.\u00a0\n\nOnce a request is approved by your manager, agreeing on a coverage plan\u2014including duties\nthat need to be reassigned while you\u2019re gone and how you can be reached in case of\nemergency\u2014will go a long way and be much appreciated.\n\nTo create clarity for your team and your manager, you should log your out-of-office time in\nOutlook calendars, in TEAMS status, and set Outlook auto-reply messages.\n\nSick leave/Holistic Health Time Off (HHTO)\n\nhttps://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/HRweb/SitePages/FAQ_DTO.aspx?xsdata=MDV8MDF8fGJjMmUzZjdlMGZjZjQwZGJjMDgzMDhkYmUwOTMzZjVmfD\u2026 8/10\n\n\f11/13/23, 1:05 PM\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ) about Discretionary Time Off (DTO)\n\nCollapse all\n\n\ue70d\n\nWhy do I have to record my sick (HHTO) time?\n\nMicrosoft maintains a separate policy for sick and safe time purposes, as many states have sick\nand safe leave laws with specific requirements.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\ue70d\n\nWhat if I run out of HHTO and need additional time away?\n\nIf you run out of HHTO, you are still covered through our Leave of Absence options, even if\nyou just require time away intermittently.\u00a0 Here are some examples:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nShort Term Disability (STD) may be taken for an employee\u2019s own medical condition.  STD pays\nat 100% of base pay for the first 8 weeks and 75% of base pay for the remaining 18 weeks. \nBeyond that, Long Term Disability benefits are available. No exhaustion or supplementing of\nHHTO/sick time is required.  While STD can be taken on a full time, continuous basis, it can\nalso be taken on a reduced schedule (e.g., 4 hours a day, etc.) or on an intermittent (e.g., 1 day\na week, etc.) basis. So, if an employee only requires leave time on occasion, they can utilize\nthis option. \u00a0\n\nFamily Caregiver Leave may be taken to care for an ill family member.  It pays at 100% of base\npay for the first 4 weeks, and the last 8 weeks are unpaid.  Employees in some states, such as\nWA, may also be eligible for additional pay during the unpaid portion of leave due to state\nlaw.  These can be found on the State Leave Notices. FCL can also be taken on a reduced\nschedule or intermittent basis.\n\nFor more information, visit the Time Away Guide.\u00a0\n\nNOTE: DTO can not be used for absences related to an employee\u2019s illness or injury, medical\nappointments and/or procedures.\n\n\ue70d\n\nWhy don\u2019t we have unlimited HHTO, too?\n\nMicrosoft offers generous time away programs to cover an array of employee needs. If you\nhave an illness or injury that requires extended time off, there are other leave of absence\noptions available to support you.

Effective communication with\nmanagers and between team members is vital to make this policy work for everyone.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis policy does not apply to absences related to an employee\u2019s illness or injury, to a family\nmember\u2019s illness or injury, or to leaves of absence, all of which are covered by separate\npolicies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNote: Employees receive Microsoft annual company holidays. \u00a0\n\nEligibility\n\nU.S. benefits eligible full and part-time salaried/exempt employees \u00a0\n\nHourly non-exempt employees, interns, visiting researchers, visiting artists and contingent\nworkers, including temporary employees, vendors, and independent contractors are not\neligible for DTO.\n\nHourly/non-exempt employees please visit HRweb to learn more: Vacation, leave of\nabsence, and time off\u00a0\n\nhttps://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/HRweb/SitePages/DTOPolicy.aspx?xsdata=MDV8MDF8fGQ1MmE3ZTQwYjk4ZTQ3MzdiMmNhMDhkYmUwOTMyZTE\u2026\n\n1/5\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\f11/13/23, 1:06 PM\n\nDiscretionary Time Off (DTO) and Holidays Policy - US Salaried/Exempt Employees\n\nEmployees with minimally integrated acquisitions are not eligible for DTO since they have\ntheir own vacation policies and approach.\u00a0\n\nCalendar: January 1\u2014December 31 \u00a0\n\nRequirements\n\nThe following requirements apply:\n\nLeaves of absence\n\nThis DTO policy does not apply to leaves of absence, and DTO under this policy cannot be\nused to compensate employees for leaves of absence.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis policy does not supersede Microsoft\u2019s leave policies for illnesses, disabilities, birth or\nbonding with a new child, military leave, family caregiver leave, jury duty leave, personal\nleave, civic leave, bereavement and other leaves of absence, some of which are mandated\nby federal, state or local law. Microsoft permits and expects employees who are qualified\nto take a leave of absence to utilize these leave programs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf an employee qualifies for and is granted a leave of absence under Microsoft\u2019s policies,\nand applicable federal or state law provides that an employee may substitute earned or\naccrued vacation time for unpaid time, the employee may not use DTO under this policy\nfor such leave, as DTO under this policy is not earned or accrued.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDisability and sick leave\n\nShort- or long-term disability benefits are governed by a separate policy. In addition,\nemployees may also be eligible to receive payments under state disability insurance\nprograms, workers\u2019 compensation insurance programs, or other third-party benefit\nprograms. DTO under this policy may not be used to cover any waiting periods under\nMicrosoft\u2019s disability benefit plans or third-party benefit programs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMicrosoft also provides all eligible employees with sick leave pursuant to Microsoft\u2019s\nHolistic Health Time Off (HHTO) policy, which employees can use for specified absences\nrelating to illness and other specified reasons. To the extent that employees work in\njurisdictions that have sick leave ordinances/laws, that policy is designed to comply with\nany applicable local or state sick leave ordinances/laws.\u00a0\n\nDTO can not be used for absences related to an employee\u2019s illness or injury, medical\nappointments and/or procedures.\n\nIf you are unsure if your reason for time is eligible for DTO, please contact AskHR.\u00a0\n\nhttps://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/HRweb/SitePages/DTOPolicy.aspx?xsdata=MDV8MDF8fGQ1MmE3ZTQwYjk4ZTQ3MzdiMmNhMDhkYmUwOTMyZTE\u2026\n\n2/5\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\f11/13/23, 1:06 PM\n\nDiscretionary Time Off (DTO) and Holidays Policy - US Salaried/Exempt Employees\n\nAttendance and Time Recording\n\nYou are not required to record or track DTO. While DTO does not require tracking, ensure\nthat you comply with the other time away reporting requirements described in the\nAttendance & Time Recording Policy.\u00a0 For instance, employees must record time away\nrelated to HHTO, bereavement, or jury duty.\u00a0\n\nCarrying forward DTO\n\nDTO under this policy is not earned or accrued at any time and is not a form of additional\nwages. Rather, it is being provided as part of our commitment to provide flexibility to our\nemployees. Because there is no time that is accrued, there is no carryover of DTO from year\nto year.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUsing DTO\n\nMicrosoft trusts employees to best manage their time against their work commitments,\nincluding scheduling time away from work.\u00a0 However, as was the case with our previous\nvacation program, you must obtain approval from your manager before you take DTO. DTO\nrequests for 4 or more consecutive weeks off require review by the direct manager plus\napproval at the GM level or above. With direct manager support of the request, the\nmanager will forward it for further GM+ review on their direct report's behalf. GM+\nemployees seeking DTO for any length of time will go to their direct manager for approval.\n\nMicrosoft encourages all employees to take advantage of this benefit by taking DTO every\nyear. If you believe that you are unable to fully utilize this benefit due to your workload,\nyou should work with your manager to adjust your workload and schedule time off.\u00a0\n\nYou are responsible for arranging for coverage as appropriate while on DTO and must still\nensure that your core business functions are covered, managed and achieved during any\nDTO. You should communicate your DTO in accordance with your manager\u2019s expectations\nto ensure business continuity. There are no limits on the amount of DTO that an employee\nmay take per year so long as you are otherwise meeting all of your performance standards\nand job responsibilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMicrosoft retains the authority in its sole discretion to deny requested DTO based on the\ncompany\u2019s business needs, employee productivity, certain busy times of the year, or for any\nother business reason. Although eligible employees are not limited in the amount of DTO\nthey may take under this policy, they are expected to work on a full-time basis.\u00a0 For part-\ntime employees, it is expected that you continue to work the number of hours agreed\nupon in your employment contract. Employees can spend as much time working as is\nnecessary both in the office and away from the office to meet business requirements and\nobligations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nhttps://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/HRweb/SitePages/DTOPolicy.aspx?xsdata=MDV8MDF8fGQ1MmE3ZTQwYjk4ZTQ3MzdiMmNhMDhkYmUwOTMyZTE\u2026\n\n3/5\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\f11/13/23, 1:06 PM\n\nDiscretionary Time Off (DTO) and Holidays Policy - US Salaried/Exempt Employees\n\nEmployees remain subject to performance expectations and standards, and the failure to\nmeet these expectations and standards or abuse of this policy may subject the employee\nto performance counseling and/or discipline, up to and including termination. Employees\nwho take DTO to the detriment of their work responsibilities may be denied the use of\nfurther DTO by their manager until their performance improves.\u00a0\n\nWhen using DTO, you will be paid at your base salary or base hourly rate of pay.\u00a0\n\nTransfers or Leaving Microsoft\n\nUnder the DTO policy, there is no accrual of time off and no entitlement to a specific\nnumber of days off per year. This means that no vacation balance will be reflected on your\npaystub or in the Time and Absence (TAR) reporting tool, and thus no accrued but unused\ntime off will be paid out upon termination. Once an employee gives notice of employment\nseparation, DTO may not be scheduled or used during the notice period. DTO may also not\nbe used to extend employment prior to an employee\u2019s termination date. \u00a0\n\nAccrued, unused vacation time will generally be cashed out only in the following\nsituations:  \u00a0\n\nIf you transfer from an International Microsoft subsidiary to the United States and\nvacation is typically paid out under the policies of the subsidiary where you were\nworking; and/or  \u00a0\nIf you were an hourly non-exempt employee and were recently promoted or moved\ninto an exempt position, you will stop accruing vacation time and will be eligible for\nDTO upon transfer. Your unused, accrued vacation and floating holiday balance, if\nany, will be paid out.\nIf you were a salaried/exempt employee and transferred into an hourly/non-exempt\nposition, your vacation accrual will begin on the first day in your non-exempt role.\u00a0\nYour vacation accrual will be\u00a0based on tenure and the applicable Corporate Hourly\nVacation or Retail Hourly Vacation policy.  If you need to use vacation time before\nyou have accrued time off, you are eligible to go into a vacation deficit, up to 80\nhours. \n\nResources\n\nDTO FAQ\nDTO Employee Quick Guide\u00a0\nTime Away Guide\u00a0\n\nhttps://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/HRweb/SitePages/DTOPolicy.aspx?xsdata=MDV8MDF8fGQ1MmE3ZTQwYjk4ZTQ3MzdiMmNhMDhkYmUwOTMyZTE\u2026\n\n4/5\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\f11/13/23, 1:06 PM\n\nDiscretionary Time Off (DTO) and Holidays Policy - US Salaried/Exempt Employees\n\n\ue8e1 \ue8e0 Did this content help you answer your question?\n\nhttps://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/HRweb/SitePages/DTOPolicy.aspx?xsdata=MDV8MDF8fGQ1MmE3ZTQwYjk4ZTQ3MzdiMmNhMDhkYmUwOTMyZTE\u2026\n\n5/5\n\n\f", "category": "hr docs"}, {"id": 2, "title": "rawData/DTO Quick Guide.pdf", "content": "i\n\ne\nd\nu\nG\nk\nc\ni\nu\nQ\ne\ne\ny\no\np\nm\nE\nO\nT\nD\n\nl\n\nDiscretionary Time Off \n(DTO)\n\nOur flexible, hybrid workplace has significantly changed the way we work \nand live, especially when it comes to how, when, and where we do our jobs. \nAs we\u2019ve transformed the way we work, we have also modernized our \nvacation policy to a more flexible model.
